## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I could practice the mobile-first approach that I recently learned from [this course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) on creating responsive layouts.
I learned the difference between button:focus and button:active and also used outline property to customise the outline on focus.

### Continued development

On the mobile view, the button keeps the changed background color on tap until tap is made outside the button area. I should figure why this is happening and then find a way to make the button get back to the original background color right on releasing the touch on the button.

### Useful resources
